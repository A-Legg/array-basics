## Exercises

Given the array ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas', 'pomegranates', 'grapes']

1. Print out an array with all of the fruit names uppercased.

--------

1. Write a program that asks for the name of your friends. The program will loop until you put in an empty line. Then, repeat back the names of all of your friends.
1. Now print all of the friend names sorted in alphabetical order.
1. Print out all of the friend names in the reverse order that you typed them.
1. Print out all of the names in reverse alphabetical order.
1. Create a nested array where each sub-array is two elements; the friend's name, and the length of their name.
